<!-- Syntax for Objects
 > an Object lets us group multiple values together.
    > to create an object, we start with an open curly bracket and end with a closed curly bracket; we can have multiple values and each value will have a property to the left of it, which is how we access it. They will be separated by a comma.
> the notation we use for identifying the value of a property is called 'dot notation.' Example. product.name > We use objects to organize our code, since we can group all the values into one object.
> We can console.log the whole object together. -->
